#vcf annotate contains different scripts for annotating vcf 

transcript to Uniprot AC
Script inputs vcf and annotates with uniprot ac based on transcript ID - snpEff - (note- need to add header line).
required mapping table download from uniprot is required (add to folder)

genetic_module
This script is for analyzing VCF (v4.1). Inputs pedigree: father, mother, proband / sibling information.  
Annotates the proband with dominant or recessice inhertiance pattern.

Minor allele frequency
This script annotates VCF with a global minor allele from the user input - ie 1000s genomes.
